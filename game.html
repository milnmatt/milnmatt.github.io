            <p>You wake up to the glorious sound of... silence. No bickering, no cartoon theme songs, just blissful quiet.</p>
            <p>A quick peek reveals your wife, the fearless leader of this domestic jungle, has vanished.  A note stuck to the fridge, written in her heroic handwriting, reads: "Honey, emergency staff meeting! Back by 7! Love, The General."  Below it, a grocery list longer than a tax form.</p><br> 
            <p>You stare at the sleeping forms of your two little terrors: Timmy, the sugar-fueled hurricane (age 6), and Sarah, the master negotiator (age 4).</p> <br>
            <h2>Do you:</h2> <h3>A: Rise to the challenge! You can handle a grocery run and some kid wrangling.</h3>
            <h3>B: Fake an illness. A strategically placed groan and a feigned cough might buy you some peace and quiet in the shed.</p></h3>
